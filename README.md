Cerebral is a Kubernetes cluster autoscaler with pluggable metrics backends and scaling engines.

# Overview

Containership's cluster autoscaler is a provider agnostic method by which to increase or decrease pools of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster in response to alerts generated by user-defined policies.
Increasing the number of nodes is important in order to meet resource demand, while decreasing the number is helpful in controlling cost.
